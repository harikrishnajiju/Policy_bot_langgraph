HR Policy: Vacation and Leave

Annual Leave
All full-time employees are entitled to 20 days of paid vacation per year, accrued monthly. Vacation days must be approved by your manager at least two weeks in advance. Unused vacation days, up to a maximum of 5, can be rolled over to the next year.

Sick Leave
Employees receive 10 days of paid sick leave per year. For an absence of three or more consecutive days, a doctor's note is required. Please notify your manager as early as possible on the day of your absence.

Remote Work Policy
We offer a hybrid work model. Employees are expected to be in the office at least two days per week (Tuesday and Wednesday). All remote work arrangements must be formally approved by your department head. Employees working remotely must maintain their standard working hours and be available for meetings.
